## Crosswords
This project was based on Newspaper crosswords. The idea was to adapt the looks
of original newspaper crosswords to digital platform.

Technologies used in the project are Html, Css and JavaScript but it is mostly
based on JavaScript.

To use this project, You need to **clone** this repository and open a file **html/home.html** 
(it will open home page of the project) or open one of the two given crosswords to start 
directly on selected crossword within **html** folder.

To make usability even simpler, this project is currently running on the link below:

Language used in this app is Croatian but it can be changed to English.
This project is opened for many upgrades and every idea is welcomed.
